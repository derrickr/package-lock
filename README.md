# package-lock

Uploaded my first repo and received a warning stating:

    We found a potential security vulnerability in one of your dependencies.
    A dependency defined in ./package-lock.json has known security vulnerabilities and should be updated.
    
    Only the owner of this repository can see this message.

I therefore created this simple repo with just the offending file to try and understand what (if anything) needs to be done.

If anyone can help that'd be great!
